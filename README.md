Modyfication of slcand command line tool from [can-utils](https://github.com/linux-can/can-utils) suited for Husarion Panther robot.

I adds ability to invoke GPIO-based reset of the microcontroller responsible for frame translateion as well as it gives the ability to use any baudrate for the CAN interface.
